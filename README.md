Ineuron Internship Project

# Objective
The goal of this project is to predict the LC50 value using Quantitative structureâ€“activity relationship models (QSAR models). The goal here is to build an end-to-end automated Machine Learning model that predicts the LC50 value, the concentration of a compound that causes 50% lethality of fish in a test batch over a duration of 96 hours, using 6 given molecular descriptors.

# Conclusion

>> The architecture that has behaved best is the Random Forest Regression with RSME value 0.94361, firstly having fewer parameters than architecture two, this being positive for running it on Arduino and achieving better results than it. In the case of architecture one, because it is simpler, it obtains fewer results.
